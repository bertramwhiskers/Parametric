Requirements
Python 3 with packages pandas, sortedcontainers, and scikit-learn.

Please save main.py, signalgeneration.py, and res_20190614.csv into the same working directory.
You can also unzip the submitted file as is. Open main.py.

Part 1: Generating order book data from raw updates
Change the read_csv call on line four to select whichever input file you would like to work with. 

Next, change the open() call on line six to match the filepath on line four, with 'output' added. This prevents the input files from being altered.

Now run the program to create a single output file as specified.

Part 2: Modelling and signal generation
The modeling and signal generation are done in signalgeneration.py. The program will read in the created CSVs output from Part 1, and append several columns with predictors and a buy/sell signal.

It is important to mention that the program filters records without either a bid or ask to facilitate predictions.

The filepath variable f needs to be adjusted on line five and follow the same output naming convention as in Part 1. The submitted version selects the last day.
